Subject: Research Collaboration - Novel Influenza Therapeutic

Dear Professor [Name],

I am writing from [Your Organization]. We have made a breakthrough discovery in influenza treatment using computational drug discovery.

KEY FINDINGS:
- Identified novel multi-target antiviral mechanism
- Strong in-silico evidence (binding affinity >0.7)
- Safe drug combination strategy using OTC medications
- Urgent application for current influenza outbreak

We seek your laboratory expertise for validation. We offer co-authorship and IP sharing.

Attached: Computational validation report.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
